#Documentation:

This Java application reads the output of the terminal command "bjobs" and displays it in a window. The output is refreshed every 1 second. The application uses the ProcessBuilder class to execute the "bjobs" command and the BufferedReader class to read the output. The output is displayed in a JTextArea within a JFrame. The update interval is implemented using a ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.

#Abstract:

The purpose of this application is to provide a convenient way to view the output of the "bjobs" command on CentOS systems. The "bjobs" command shows information about batch jobs that are running or have completed on the system. By running this command in a Java application and refreshing the output every 1 second, users can easily monitor the status of their batch jobs without having to manually run the command in the terminal. The application presents the output in a formatted manner, making it easier to read and understand.
